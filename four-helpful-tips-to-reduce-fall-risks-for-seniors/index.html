        <p>For those of us under the age of 65, it usually leads to a bruise, scrape or bump that will heal faster than our egos. However, as we age, the risks associated with falls drastically increases. For older people, a fall could result in breaks, expensive medical bills, and more serious health conditions.</p><p>Not only are falls more serious for seniors, but they are also more prevalent. According to the National Institute on Aging, one in three adults over the age of 65 fall each year. So, if you are an older person, the important question is 'how do you decrease your risk of falling'. Fortunately, there are some easy steps that you and your loved ones can take to reduce your chances of falling.</p><p><b>1. Stay Active</b></p><p>Muscle weakness, gait, and balance are all factors that can increase your risk of falling. Although, it may seem safer to stay home and reduce your physical activity, moving your body every day is an important to keep up your strength and stability. Low impact exercises, walks around your neighborhood, lunch with a friend, and your weekly errands are great ways to keep your body and mind active!</p><p><b>2. Keep up with your doctor's visits and medications</b></p><p>Your muscles are not the only part of your body that contribute to your risk of falling. It is important to stay on top of your appointments, including getting your eyesight and hearing checked. Visual and auditory impairments can contribute to your risk of falling. When you are at your doctor appointments, make sure that you have a good understanding of the potential side effects of any medications you are on so you can access if they may decrease your balance and stability. Also, make sure that you are checking in with you doctor if you have diabetes or blood pressure issues. If not properly managed, these conditions could increase your chances of a fall.</p><p><b>3. Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle</b></p><p>A good night's sleep and a well-balanced diet are important no matter your age. However, sleep and a proper diet can help you stay alert as you go about your day. For that same reason, limiting your alcohol intake can also help you keep focus and be aware of your surroundings.</p><p><b>4. Be Aware and Modify Your Environment</b></p><p>Keeping our bodies healthy is only one part of the equation when it comes to a fall. Another key element that increases the risks of falls for seniors is your environment. Set yourself up for success by evaluating and modifying areas in your home to decrease the amount of tripping hazards.</p><p>Things you can modify:</p><p><b>Cords</b> - Make sure they secured to the floor and out of your walking path.</p><p><b>Rugs</b> - Rug tape and mats can help keeps them from bunching up and become a hazard.</p><p><b>Pets</b> - Pets love to be under your feet! Consider putting a bell on their collar so you hear them even when you don't see them.</p><p><b>Furniture</b> - Give yourself room to walk. Moving furniture with sharp or protruding edges can help keep you from bumping into them. You may also want to consider downsizing, if it takes up too much space.</p><p><b>Clutter</b> - Keep things off the floor!</p><p>There is only so much that you can control in your environment so always make sure to be aware of your surroundings. This world is so focused on speed and efficiency that you can get swept up in the moment and not see a potential hazard before it's too late. Take your time and let other people wait on you!</p>
