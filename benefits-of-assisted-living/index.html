        <p>For many years, people have equated assisted living communities with nursing homes.</p><p>However, in reality, assisted living communities are vastly different from skilled nursing facilities.</p><p>Assisted living communities are ever changing. They evolve to meet the needs of the newest generation entering their care. Many assisted living communities offer a range of care services that allow residents to live independently while still receiving the proper care that they need. They provide a vibrant living environment that allows seniors in various stages of life to live happy and carefree.</p><p><b>REDUCTION IN SOCIAL ISOLATION</b></p><p>Many seniors experience social isolation when living alone at home. Many things can contribute to this isolation including: the passing of a spouse and close friends, the proximity of their children, and their ability to drive and move around. Although, social isolation is detrimental to everyone, it is especially concerning for seniors. In fact, the CDC considers loneliness and isolation to be a serious health risk to seniors.</p><p>Assisted living communities can provide a solution to your loved one's social isolation. Not only can you choose a community located closer to family and friends, but also your loved one is going to be living mere steps away from potential new friends. In addition, assisted living communities provide daily activities and communal meals where your loved can get out of their room and enjoy their day in the company of others.</p><p>The communities aim to provide a variety of activities to meet every resident need including: games, fitness, happy hour, crafts, art, outing and entertainment.</p><p><b>WELLNESS PROGRAMS</b></p><p>As we get older, it can become more difficult to find physical activities that are geared towards your bodies needs. Fortunately, assisted living communities are constantly developing wellness programs that target the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of today's seniors.</p><p>Your loved one could be taking a yoga class in the morning, learning about nutrition through a workshop with a trained professional before lunch, playing brain games in the afternoon, and meditating before dinner.</p><p>They get the benefit of all these great resources without feeling intimidated or nervous, because all the other people around them are their same age.</p><p><b>MORE FREE TIME</b></p><p>The day-to-day activities of tending to a home can become challenging and troublesome to a senior.</p><p>Assisted living communities offer a solution. They often provide three meals a day, snacks, laundry services, and weekly housekeeping in their monthly rent price. Some communities even include more upscale features like room service. The goal being to provide their residents with an increased quality of life and give them the opportunity to enjoy their later years hanging out with their friends and engaging in enjoyable activities.</p><p><b>PEACE OF MIND</b></p><p>Unfortunately, for many families, the conversation about senior living starts when there is an accident or notable behavior change with a loved one. Between the mental declines that seniors can experience with social isolation and the physical declines seen with aging, the idea of a loved one living alone can create a lot of stress. Often, even when a senior moves in with a family member, there is still stress involved with acting as a caregiver for your loved one.</p><p>However, when you place your loved one in an assisted living community, there is peace of mind in knowing that they are always going to have someone available to meet their care needs. Your loved one will have daily check ins from staff members, activities to participate in, balanced meals, and trained caregivers to help them with daily activities.</p><p>So, although many find it difficult to place their family member in an assisted living at first, they often feel relieved after seeing their loved one thrive in their new home.</p>
