          <div class="faq-list">
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Does Medicare/Medicaid cover senior living?</h3>
              <p>Medicare does not cover the cost of senior living. Medicaid will generally help with assisted living costs. Medicaid does not pay for the room and board for the assisted living, but only can pay for the medical portion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>How much is the cost of monthly care?</h3>
              <p>The level of care differs from community to community and is determined by an assessment of your loved one's care needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Are veterans benefits available for long term care?</h3>
              <p>Yes, benefits are available. The VA provides supplemental income through the Veterans Pension to veterans and their widowed spouses. Then, veterans and spouses who require care and assistance may be eligible for Aid & Attendance financial benefits. Veterans and spouses who are homebound may qualify for additional benefits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>How much do our services cost?</h3>
              <p>There is no cost to seniors and their families. We are compensated by the senior housing community if there is a move.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>What are some signs someone needs assisted living?</h3>
              <p>Signs include decline in physical or mental health, experiencing one or more falls, forgetting to take medications, poor hygiene, not eating properly, or no longer taking interest in favorite activities. Displaying signs of depression and isolation are also indicators that your loved one may not be safe at home any longer and would benefit from socialization, prepared meals, housekeeping, and 24/7 care.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>What are the benefits of choosing a senior care advising agency over websites that just process senior care leads?</h3>
              <p>The most significant difference with a company like Benevolent Senior Services is that, unlike senior lead processing companies, our Senior Advisors meet in person or via Zoom with every family and senior we work with. We guide you throughout the entire transition to ensure your loved one has the best possible outcome with the community you select together. Our team can provide this personalized service because of our extensive experience working with seniors and comprehensive knowledge of all aspects of senior housing.</p>
